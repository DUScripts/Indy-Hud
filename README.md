<!-- ABOUT INDY HUD -->
## About Indy HUD

This is an augmented reality HUD for tracking states of your industry machines for Dual Universe. This script only requires a single programming board, and can manage all the units on a single core factory. 

_What This HUD Isn't:_
* Not an automation tool; it cannot start or stop machines
* Not a recipe tool; it will not show recipe trees for items

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

_This programming board HUD is delivered by "json" import, a feature supported by Dual Universe for custom scripts. You will need to download a file as instructed below to use this HUD._

### File Install

1. Download the json file from this repo, (right-click this link and "Save link as") [ais_indy_hud][download-url]
2. Open the json file in any text editor. Select all of the contents (CTRL+A to select all), and then copy (CTRL+C).
3. In the game, you'll need to place a Programming Board at your factory.
4. Right-click the programming board, go to "Advanced"
5. Click "Paste Lua Configuration From Clipboard"
6. In build mode, use the Link tool to link your construct's Core to the programming board.

That's it! Run the board now and enjoy.

But keep in mind this is a free resource, and I've spent a good chunk of time on it, so please be constructive and kind :)_
